## Validate Infrastructure as Code using PSRule


The resources for this session are all available [here](https://aka.ms/psconfeu2023/psrule)

There is a devcontainer included, so you can clone the referenced repository, open the folder containing the demo-files in VS Code and then use the option 'Reopen in container' to get everything you need to follow the examples without installing anything locally (besides VS Code and Docker Desktop).

Thanks for coming to the session!
