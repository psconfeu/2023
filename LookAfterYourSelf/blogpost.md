# Look After Yourself
with Rob Sewell, Barbara Forbes, Paul Broadwith and Joe Houghes

## Last Year

I have never had a response to any session that I have been a part of as much as last years Mental Health session at PSConfEU. We received a significant number of emails and DM's over many social medias for a significant time. People telling their stories, people apprecitaing the fact that we took the time at an international technical conference to bring Mental Health to the forefront of everyones minds for an hour.

We also had not recognised the possibility of the imapct on people during the session. The topics triggered a number of people in a number of ways and we were not prepared for that adn I personally was not able to support those people at the end of the session.

## This Year

People were already mentioning that they were looking forward to a similar session this year. I decided therefore to put some guard rails around this and to bring some people on stage to tell their stories and to talk about the impact of coming out of  thye other side of the pandemic and how _everything was now ok_ (Editor - It was **not** OK)

We decided that this information was worth sharing with the wider community hence this blog post was born.

# Safety Goggles

First, just like in Prague, we want to say please look after yourself, please be aware of your own triggers and that this post may poke some of them. Also, that we are 4 folk who do tech and maybe none of what we say will work for you, please use the professionals in your country if you need them.

## Understand what helps you

I talked about finding the thing that you can do that helps to calm you. For me it is cycling, planning a route, getting ready, getting on my bike and then concentrating only on pedalling, navigating, remmebering to eat and drink, enjoying the countryside and the smells and the views. I understand about myself that taking the time to do this before a conference enables me to have the capacity to deal with all of the stress and the people and the uncomfortableness of being in public. For me, after a conference it is a great way to recharge but it is also something that I do most days of the week as way of being away from the constant yelling of social media, of work emails, teams messages and the like.

Find the thing that works for you. I know that some people use gaming or gardening, reading books or drawing, DIY or long walks. It doesnt matter what it is, the thing is to find it and make it part of your routine.

## Dealing with the firehose

I talked about how to deal with the firehose of new information that is continuously coming our way. None of it was my information, coming mainly from the amazing Cathrine Wilhelmsen and the awesome Andr√© Kamman. All credit goes to them.

## How do I keep up?

- You don't, You can't keep up with __everything__
- Ask yourself
    - What do I want to learn
    - What do I have to learn
    - What do I need to learn
    - What do I need to learn NOW
    This last one is the one to concentrate on
- Then, like you would eat an elephant, take small steps each day. Remember that a little bit each day will not feel like much every day but you should only measure it over a longer time and then you will see what progress you have made.
